### Why

Organic Fertilizers are way far safer to use as they are not as concentrated as synthetic fertilizers. 
Being ecologically and environmentally safe and non-toxic in nature, organic fertilizers are the best fertilizers for plants and crops in farming.

### How

We partner with the public by collecting the organic waste generated, transform them into organic fertilizers which are been used by the farmers.
By knowing our end-users needs, we know how to best prepare our products to fill their expectations.

### What

For starters, keeping your soil healthy is the key to a beautiful garden, and how we make the soil nutritious for the plants is what will make or break our gardens. One of the best ways to ensure that your soil is receiving all the nutrients is by constantly feeding it with organic fertilizers. At CEL, the raw materials which are the organic waste are collected from the general public and then stored for a period of time before been crushed and mixed.
Compositing & fermentation takes place before its granulated, screened and finally packaged for the end users.
