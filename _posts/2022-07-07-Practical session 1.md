## Create and Assume Roles in AWS

# Introduction
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that allows AWS customers to manage user access and permissions for the accounts and available APIs/services within AWS. IAM can manage users, security credentials (such as API access keys), and allow users to access AWS resources.
In this lab, I discovered how security policies affect IAM users and groups, and I went further by implementing my own policy while also learning what a role is, how to create a role, and how to assume a role as a different user.
By the end of this lab, I understood IAM policies and roles, and how assuming roles can assist in restricting users to specific AWS resources.

# Solution
Logged in to the AWS Management Console using the credentials provided on the lab instructions page. Made sure I was in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) region throughout the lab.

## Create the Correct S3 Restricted Policies and Roles
# Create the S3RestrictedPolicy
 1.	Once I logged in to the AWS Management Console, navigated to IAM.
 2.	From the left-side menu, click **Policies**.
 3.	Click **Create Policy**.
 4.	In *Service*, click **Choose a service**.
 5.	Type and select **S3**.
 6.	In *Actions*, select **All S3 actions**.
 7.	Click the arrow next to *Resources*, and select **Any** or **Any in this account** for all resources other than *bucket*.
 8.	Open a new browser tab, and navigate to S3.
 9.	Under *Buckets*, copy the bucket name containing appconfigprod1.
 10. Return to IAM.
 11. In Resources, under bucket, click **Add ARN**.
 12. Paste in the Bucket name I just copied, and click **Add**.
 13. Return to S3 and repeat the process with the bucket name containing appconfigprod2.
 14. In IAM, once both buckets are added, click **Next: Tags**.
 15. Click **Next: Review**.
 16. For *Name*, enter "S3RestrictedPolicy", and click **Create policy**.

# Create the S3RestrictedRole
 1.	From the IAM dashboard menu, select **Roles**.
 2.	Click **Create role**.
 3.	Under *Trusted entity type*, select **AWS account**.
 4.	Under the *An AWS account section* that pops up, make sure **This account** is selected.
 5.	Copy the account number next to *This account*. I needed this later in the lab.
 6.	Click **Next**.
 7.	In the search field, enter "S3" and select S3RestrictedPolicy.
 8.	Click **Next**.
 9.	In *Role name*, enter "S3RestrictedRole". I should see in the JSON block that the trusted entity is Ir account number. This means that anything that is in this account can assume this role.
 10. Click **Create role**.

# Revoke the S3 Administrator Access Policy to the dev1 User
 1.	AWS now auto logs out when logging in as another user (even if in a new Incognito/Private Window). As a work around, I can right-click the lab's blue "Open Link in Incognito/Private Window` button and copy the link into a different browser. I'll then be able to be logged into the other account using the lab provided credentials.
 2.	Use the following credentials to log in:
    - o *Account ID*: The same account ID I previously copied
    - o *User*: dev1
    - o *Password*: 3Kk6!AY36^5h1rolJYb@C
 3.	Navigate to S3 to see what this user has access to.
 4.	Select one of the customerdata buckets and open it in a new tab. I should see that there are no objects, but I do have access to it.
 5.	Back in S3, select one of the appconfig buckets, and open it in a new tab. I should see the same access as the customerdata bucket.
 6.	Go back to the original IAM browser window that I had open.
 7.	From the left-side menu, select **User groups**.
 8.	Select the developergroup.
 9.	Select *Permissions*.
 10. Select the AmazonS3FullAccess policy, and click **Remove**.
 11. Click **Delete**.
 12. Go back to the other incognito windows for the dev1 user.
 13. Refresh both windows for the customerdata and appconfig buckets. Note that I will now see an error indicating the user has insufficient permissions to list objects.

# Attach the S3RestrictedPolicy to the dev1 User
 1.	Go back to the original IAM browser window.
 2.	On the left-side menu, select **Users**.
 3.	Select the dev1 user.
 4.	Under *Permissions*, click **Add permissions**.
 5.	Select **Attach existing policies directly**.
 6.	In the search bar, type "S3" and select S3RestrictedPolicy.
 7.	Click **Next: Review**.
 8.	Click **Add permissions**.
 9.	Click the arrow next to the policy, and select **{} JSON** to display and review the policy's contents.
 10. To verify the configuration, return to the dev1 browser and attempt to access the appconfig and customerdata buckets. I should now have access to appconfig buckets, while customerdata buckets are still denied.

# Configure IAM So the dev3 User Can Assume the Role
# Create the AssumeS3Policy IAM Policy
 1.	Open a new incognito browser window using the same account ID as before. Log in as the dev3 user using the following credentials:
    - o *User*: dev3
    - o *Password*: 3Kk6!AY36^5h1rolJYb@C
 2.	Navigate to S3. Note that dev3and verify the user's current access.
 3.	Go back to the original IAM browser window.
 4.	From the left-side menu, select **Policies**.
 5.	Click **Create policy**.
 6.	In *Service*, click **Choose a service**.
 7.	Type and select **STS**.
 8.	In Actions under Access level, click the arrow next to Write to expand its options, and select **AssumeRole**.
 9.	In Resources under role, click **Add ARN**.
 10. In the *Add ARN(s)* pop-up window, set *Role name with path* to "S3RestrictedRole" and click **Add**.
 11. Click **Next: Tags**.
 12. Click **Next: Review**.
 13. For *Name*, enter "AssumeS3Policy", and click **Create policy**.

# Attach the AssumeS3Policy to the dev3 User
 1.	Select the new policy.
 2.	Select the *Policy usage tab*, and click **Attach**.
 3.	Select *dev3*, and click **Attach policy**.

# Assume the S3RestrictedRole as the dev3 User
 1.	Go back to the other browser window where I are logged in as dev3 in S3.
 2.	Notice that the dev3 user still doesn't have bucket access because the role has not yet been assumed.
 3.	To assume the role, click the user dropdown on the top menu, and copy Ir account ID in Ir clipboard.
 4.	Click **Switch Roles**.
 5.	In the new window, click **Switch Role**.
 6.	Set the following values:
    - o	*Account*: The account ID I just copied
    - o	*Role*: S3RestrictedRole
    - o	*Display Name*: S3RestrictedRole
 7.	Click **Switch Role**.
 8. To verify the role has been assumed, attempt to access the appconfig and customer data buckets. I should now have access to appconfig buckets, while customer data buckets are still denied.

# Conclusion
Congratulations â€” Thats how I've completed this hands-on lab!
