## Github + Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 

 1. Having created a Jekyll blog page on Github, I followed the tutorial video given to me to create my own free website.
 2. Never had a code editor yet, so I made no mistake by picking VS Code. Downloaded and installed the version that is right for my operating system (Windows 8.1).
 3. Made sure I installed Git on my Windows 8.1. Very important if not VS Code can't install the ***GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension***, which I will need to sign in my Github account.
 4. Now went further to ***clone my Github repo*** and edited it in VS Code just by searching ***Github: Clone*** and then typed in my repo.
